DO NOT REMOVE THIS CODE

This code makes the base of the app, removing this will break the code.

DEF

This defines all the variables, including the ones imported from other files, especially the most important one, ```self.initUI```
The most important ```def``` is ```initUI```. This develops the main GUI, which is the second most important class within the entire code. 

The other classes determine how each function works within the GUI and how it will be presented, you can change the appearance but keep the functions as it. In the future, we will change them depending on how we change their appearance.

For documentation, I wouldn't recommend PyQt5's website, if you have VSCode (which is highly recommended, install the extension "Tabnine AI" (you may research how this extension works yourself). If you don't use VSCode, use ChatGPT. DO NOT ASK FOR IT TO CODE FOR YOU. This will eliminate the purpose of your learning, and how it goes towards your CV. Only use it for documentation.
